The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in research output
surrounding various aspects of the pandemic, ranging in scale from the
molecular to the population level. Unsurprisingly, there has been a
number of preprints in the field of cheminformatics that attempt to
address questions surrounding the disease. For example, a series of
virtual screening publications have proposed potentially interesting
candidates. Indeed, Open Source and Open Data has lowered the cost of
running cheminformatics experiments.

During a recent conversation with our Editorial Board we discussed the
possibility of a thematic issue in the
[Journal of Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/) on
COVID19. We decided not to pursue such an effort, mainly since much of
the work that might be topical for the journal was focused on applying
pre-existing pipelines to prioritize compounds as potential
candidates. As noted earlier, we have decided that other
venues would be more suitable to applications of such standard
pipelines .In addition, given the urgency of the situation we felt that
computational predictions without some form of experimental
verification would not be very useful.

Even though we have decided to not focus on COVID-19 publications, we
believe that it is important to consider how cheminformatics can 
contribute to studies of pandemic diseases. This editorial addresses
this question. We first identify the
major research questions around the COVID-19 pandemic where
cheminformatics can contribute. Second, we identify how the field of
cheminformatics should continue to become more open to be more
prepared for the next viral outbreak, hoping we can contribute to
mitigation efforts to prevent it from becoming a pandemic.

### Chemical information

#### Emergency Access

Many publishers removed the paywalls to their COVID19-related content. We stress this is
not Open Science and at best *emergency Open Access*. However, collected in the CORD-19 data set,
the papers are available for text and data mining [<cite>Q93445532</cite>] which can still benefit
population of open science resources [REFS]. However, scholars may loose access to the literature
after the paywalls are put up again, making it hard to study the details behind the knowledge they
find in databases.

#### Annotated literature

Keywords etc, InChI and SMILES

##### Keywords on steriods

InChIs and/or SMILES for the chemicals described in articles

##### Open Citations

#### Access to Open Data

##### Physicochemical Properties

Open pKa, logD, ... data, where each measured property is backed by a literature reference.

#### Interoperability


### Infrastructure

Along with FAIR data, infrastructure that enables researchers to use
cheminformatics methods and toolkits, and then deploy solutions in a
straightforward fashion can enable reuse and thereby encourage
application and replication within the community. To a large degree,
Open Source toolkits have democratized access to cheminformatics
methods, and platforms such as KNIME enable easy deployment of
solutions. Resources such as Github and Bitbucket are also critical
infrastructure that enable the community to access, modify and
contribute to published code. We note that the infrastructure
described here should also apply to data. While version control
platforms may not be suitable for large datasets, resources such as
Figshare and Zenodo are capable to handling datasets and their
associated metadata.


### New avenues for dissemination

A final question that should be asked, is the journal article even the
right platform to share knowledge during a pandemic. While peer review
is important, it is not a guarantee fo reliability. Indeed, several
COVID19 articles have been retracted shortly after they were published
[REFS]. While it is unlikely that peer review will be replaced,
mechanisms to support curation and usage tracking will enhance
rapid publication processes.

Another aspect, relevant to rapid publication needs is that journal
articles suffer from the "version of record" limitation: once
published, making corrections is hard, though corrigenda and
errata are possible, they are rare. Efforts such as the Live Journal
of Computational Molecular Science (LiveCoMS) [REF], which support the
publication of "live" reviews (i.e., review articles that are updated
on an ongoing basis) highlight how published articles can undergo
continuous revision.
