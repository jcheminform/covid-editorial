	Abstract = {The flexibility and scope of the R programming environment has made it a popular choice for statistical modeling and scientific prototyping in a number of fields. In the field of chemistry, R provides several tools for a variety of problems related to statistical modeling of chemical information. However, one aspect common to these tools is that they do not have direct access to the information that is available from chemical structures, such as contained in molecular descriptors.

We describe the rcdk package that provides the R user with access to the CDK, a Java framework for cheminformatics. As a result, it is possible to read in a variety of molecular formats, calculate molecular descriptors and evaluate fingerprints. In addition, we describe the rpubchem that will allow access to the data in PubChem, a public repository of molecular structures and associated assay data for approximately 8 million compounds. Currently the package allows access to structural information as well as some simple molecular properties from PubChem. In addition the package allows access to bio-assay data from the PubChem FTP servers. },

@article{cc_stats_3,
	Abstract = {Analytic formulae are used to estimate the error for two virtual screening metrics, enrichment factor and area under the ROC curve. These analytic error estimates are then compared to bootstrapping error estimates, and shown to have excellent agreement with respect to area under the ROC curve and good agreement with respect to enrichment factor. The major advantage of the analytic formulae is that they are trivial to calculate and depend only on the number of actives and inactives and the measured value of the metric, information commonly reported in papers. In contrast to this, the bootstrapping method requires the individual compound scores. Methods for converting the error, which is calculated as a variance, into more familiar error bars are also discussed.},

@article{cc_stats_1,
	Abstract = {The calculation of error bars for quantities of interest in computational chemistry comes in two forms: (1) Determining the confidence of a prediction, for instance of the property of a molecule; (2) Assessing uncertainty in measuring the difference between properties, for instance between performance metrics of two or more computational approaches. While a former paper in this series concentrated on the first of these, this second paper focuses on comparison, i.e. how do we calculate differences in methods in an accurate and statistically valid manner. Described within are classical statistical approaches for comparing widely used metrics such as enrichment, area under the curve and Pearson's product-moment coefficient, as well as generic measures. These are considered of over single and multiple sets of data and for two or more methods that evince either independent or correlated behavior. General issues concerning significance testing and confidence limits from a Bayesian perspective are discussed, along with size-of-effect aspects of evaluation.},
