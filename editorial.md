The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in research output
surrounding various aspects of the pandemic, ranging in scale from the
molecular to the population level. Unsurprisingly, there has been a
number of preprints in the field of cheminformatics that attempt to
address questions surrounding the disease. For example, a series of
virtual screening publications have proposed potentially interesting
candidates. Indeed, Open Source and Open Data has lowered the cost of
running cheminformatics experiments. During a recent conversation with our
Editorial Board we discussed the possibility of a thematic issue in the
[Journal of Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/) on
COVID19. We decided not to pursue such an effort.

This editorial outlines what we believe cheminformatics could
contribute to studies of pandemic diseases. We first identify the
major research questions around the COVID-19 pandemic where
cheminformatics can contribute. Second, we identify how the field of
cheminformatics should continue to become more open to be more
prepared for the next viral outbreak, hoping we can contribute to
mitigation efforts to prevent it from becoming a pandemic.

## How does cheminformatics contribute to virus research

## Better prepared with more open cheminformatics

### Chemical information

#### Emergency Access

Many publishers removed the paywalls to their COVID19-related content. We stress this is
not Open Science and at best *emergency Open Access*. However, collected in the CORD-19 data set,
the papers are available for text and data mining [<a href="#citeref1">1</a>] which can still benefit
population of open science resources [REFS]. However, scholars may loose access to the literature
after the paywalls are put up again, making it hard to study the details behind the knowledge they
find in databases.

#### Annotated literature

##### Keywords on steriods

InChIs and/or SMILES for the chemicals described in articles

##### Open Citations

#### Access to Open Data

##### Physicochemical Properties

Open pKa, logD, ... data, where each measured property is backed by a literature reference.

#### Interoperability


### Infrastructure

#### Easy to deploy cheminformatics

#### Application Programming Interfaces


### New avenues for dissemination

A final question that should be asked, is the journal article even the right platform for share
knowledge during a pandemic. Of course, peer review remains essential, but perhaps the peer review
of an article does not lead to the best results. Indeed, several COVID19 articles have been
retracted shortly after they were published [REFS]. Here, Open Science takes an intrinsically
different approach: it is not less than a handful of scholars that decide what is knowledge and
what is not, but it is curation and continuous use that highlights errors.

Second, journal articles
suffer from the "version of record" limitation: once published, making corrections is hard. Where
open science can make frequent releases ("release soon, release often"), a journal article release
is in most cases a one time event, and while corrigenda and errata are possible, they are rare.
