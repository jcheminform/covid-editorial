@article{cc_stats_3,
	Abstract = {Analytic formulae are used to estimate the error for two virtual screening metrics, enrichment factor and area under the ROC curve. These analytic error estimates are then compared to bootstrapping error estimates, and shown to have excellent agreement with respect to area under the ROC curve and good agreement with respect to enrichment factor. The major advantage of the analytic formulae is that they are trivial to calculate and depend only on the number of actives and inactives and the measured value of the metric, information commonly reported in papers. In contrast to this, the bootstrapping method requires the individual compound scores. Methods for converting the error, which is calculated as a variance, into more familiar error bars are also discussed.},

@article{cc_stats_1,
	Abstract = {The calculation of error bars for quantities of interest in computational chemistry comes in two forms: (1) Determining the confidence of a prediction, for instance of the property of a molecule; (2) Assessing uncertainty in measuring the difference between properties, for instance between performance metrics of two or more computational approaches. While a former paper in this series concentrated on the first of these, this second paper focuses on comparison, i.e. how do we calculate differences in methods in an accurate and statistically valid manner. Described within are classical statistical approaches for comparing widely used metrics such as enrichment, area under the curve and Pearson's product-moment coefficient, as well as generic measures. These are considered of over single and multiple sets of data and for two or more methods that evince either independent or correlated behavior. General issues concerning significance testing and confidence limits from a Bayesian perspective are discussed, along with size-of-effect aspects of evaluation.},

abstract = {Abstract After nearly five decades “in the making”, QSAR modeling has established itself as one of the major computational molecular modeling methodologies. As any mature research discipline, QSAR modeling can be characterized by a collection of well defined protocols and procedures that enable the expert application of the method for exploring and exploiting ever growing collections of biologically active chemical compounds. This review examines most critical QSAR modeling routines that we regard as best practices in the field. We discuss these procedures in the context of integrative predictive QSAR modeling workflow that is focused on achieving models of the highest statistical rigor and external predictive power. Specific elements of the workflow consist of data preparation including chemical structure (and when possible, associated biological data) curation, outlier detection, dataset balancing, and model validation. We especially emphasize procedures used to validate models, both internally and externally, as well as the need to define model applicability domains that should be used when models are employed for the prediction of external compounds or compound libraries. Finally, we present several examples of successful applications of QSAR models for virtual screening to identify experimentally confirmed hits.},
