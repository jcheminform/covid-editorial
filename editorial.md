The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a spur of research. As if everyone like to contribute to a solution
from their area of expertise. It also led to new publications in the area of cheminformatics. For example,
a series of virtual screening publications have proposed potentially interesting candidates. Indeed,
open source and open data has lowered the cost of running cheminformatics experiments. During a recent
telon with our Editorial Board the question came up if we wanted to have thematic series in the 
[Journal of Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/) on
COVID19. We decided not. This editorial outlines what we think the cheminformatics could do to easy the 
*second wave* but in particular what it should do to be prepared for the next pandemic.

## Chemical information

### Emergency Access

Many publishers removed the paywalls to their COVID19-related content. We stress this is
not Open Science and at best *emergency Open Access*. However, collected in the CORD-19 data set,
the papers are available for text and data mining [<a href="#citeref1">1</a>] which can still benefit
population of open science resources [REFS]. However, scholars may loose access to the literature
after the paywalls are put up again, making it hard to study the details behind the knowledge they
find in databases.

### Annotated literature

#### Keywords on steriods

InChIs and/or SMILES for the chemicals described in articles

#### Open Citations

### Access to Open Data

#### Physicochemical Properties

Open pKa, logD, ... data, where each measured property is backed by a literature reference.

### Interoperability


## Infrastructure

### Easy to deploy cheminformatics

### Application Programming Interfaces


## New avenues for dissemination

A final question that should be asked, is the journal article even the right platform for share
knowledge during a pandemic. Of course, peer review remains essential, but perhaps the peer review
of an article does not lead to the best results. Indeed, several COVID19 articles have been
retracted shortly after they were published [REFS]. Here, Open Science takes an intrinsically
different approach: it is not less than a handful of scholars that decide what is knowledge and
what is not, but it is curation and continuous use that highlights errors.

Second, journal articles
suffer from the "version of record" limitation: once published, making corrections is hard. Where
open science can make frequent releases ("release soon, release often"), a journal article release
is in most cases a one time event, and while corrigenda and errata are possible, they are rare.
